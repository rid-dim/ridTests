We recommend using anaconda environments (because they are very powerful and it's easy to switch between python versions when using them)

The easiest way to get a very powerful environment after installing anaconda is doing a

> conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda

in the command line which installs python 3.6 with jupyter notebooks, pandas, numpy, ... (a lot of wonderful packages you will often need anyway)

then depending on your OS you'll need to do on Windows:

> activate py36
> pip install pySafe

or on Linux:

> source activate py36
> pip install pySafe

and you're already ready to rumble!

If you open a new console you should be able to enter:

> safeConn

and you should see a succeeding test to connect to the SAFE Network!
